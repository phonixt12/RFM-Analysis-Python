    "# RFM Analysis in Python - Customer Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customer segmentation** is the practice of grouping customers based on common characteristics. These customer segments are beneficial in marketing campaigns, in identifying potentially profitable customers, and in developing customer loyalty. A company might segment customers according to a wide range of factors, including: demographics (age, gender, location etc), behaviour (previous orders, responses to messaging), psychographics (values, interests, lifestyles) etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary)** analysis is a simple technique for behaviour based customer segmentation. It groups customers based on their transaction history â€“ how recently, how often and how much did they buy. It is a handy method to find the best customers, understand their behavior and then run targeted marketing campaigns to increase sales, satisfaction and customer lifetime value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to identify customer segments for global retail company using RFM analysis and to understand how those groups differ from each other."
