# Definition of RFM analyis
RFM is an acronym representing Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, wherein each component correlates with crucial customer attributes. These RFM metrics serve as significant indicators of customer behavior, as frequency and monetary value directly impact a customer's lifetime value, while recency influences retention, a metric reflective of engagement

# The benefit of RFM analysis
Businesses without a direct monetary component, such as those focused on viewership, readership, or surfing-oriented products, may opt for Engagement parameters in lieu of Monetary factors. This adaptation results in the utilization of RFE, a variant of RFM. Moreover, the Engagement parameter can be delineated as a composite value derived from metrics such as bounce rate, visit duration, number of pages visited, time spent per page, among others.

The RFM factors underscore the following insights:

The recency of a purchase positively correlates with the customer's responsiveness to promotions.
Higher frequency in customer purchases indicates increased engagement and satisfaction.
The monetary value serves as a distinguishing factor, delineating heavy spenders from low-value purchasers

# Introduction
### 1. Business question
"SuperStore Company is a global retail company - Global. So the company has many customers.
On the occasion of Christmas and New Year, the Marketing Department wants to run marketing campaigns to thank customers for supporting the company over the past time. As well as exploiting customers who have the potential to become loyal customers.

However, the Marketing Department has not yet been able to group each customer this year because the data set is too large to be processed manually like in previous years, so we asked the Data Analysis Department to assist in implementing a classification problem. Segment each customer to deploy each marketing program suitable for each customer group.

The Marketing Director also suggested using the RFM model, but in the past when the company was small, the team could calculate and classify it themselves using Excel. Currently, the amount of data is too large, so we want the Data Department to build a flow to deploy Segmentation evaluation through Python programming
### 2. Dataset
