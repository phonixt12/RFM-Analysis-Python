# Definition of RFM analyis
RFM is an acronym representing Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, wherein each component correlates with crucial customer attributes. These RFM metrics serve as significant indicators of customer behavior, as frequency and monetary value directly impact a customer's lifetime value, while recency influences retention, a metric reflective of engagement

# The benefit of RFM analysis
Businesses without a direct monetary component, such as those focused on viewership, readership, or surfing-oriented products, may opt for Engagement parameters in lieu of Monetary factors. This adaptation results in the utilization of RFE, a variant of RFM. Moreover, the Engagement parameter can be delineated as a composite value derived from metrics such as bounce rate, visit duration, number of pages visited, time spent per page, among others.

The RFM factors underscore the following insights:

The recency of a purchase positively correlates with the customer's responsiveness to promotions.
Higher frequency in customer purchases indicates increased engagement and satisfaction.
The monetary value serves as a distinguishing factor, delineating heavy spenders from low-value purchasers


# The Case Study
This case study use to demonstrate my skill in python. In this case study, the bussines's condition is aznalyzed by author accroding in dataset. Author will give some views about business's situations, give insight and solution.
